I acknowledge the use of GitHub Copilot in the development of this project.
Gen-AI was used in the following ways:

- Generating initial drafts of textual content for the Home, Televisions, and About Us pages (e.g. mission statements, key facts lists, energy efficiency tips, and explanatory paragraphs based on Australian energy context).
- Suggesting improvements and completing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippets to implement navigation, active link highlighting, page structure consistency, and event handling (after I provided the base HTML skeleton and navigation concept).
- Refining wording for clarity, factual accuracy, and user-friendliness in the provided content sections.
- All AI-generated text and code suggestions were carefully reviewed, edited, fact-checked by me to ensure they aligned with the project requirements and my own understanding.
