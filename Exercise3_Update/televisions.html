  <h2>Data Insights: Choosing the Right Television</h2>

  <p>
    Buying a television can be difficult due to the wide range of brands,
    screen technologies, and energy consumption levels available on the
    market. This analysis focuses on helping consumers make informed
    decisions by comparing the most popular television brands and identifying
    which options provide the best viewing quality and energy efficiency.

  <!-- Question 1 -->
  <div class="chart-block">
    <h3>Among the most popular brands, which screen technology provides the best viewing experience?</h3>

    <p>
      To ensure fair comparison, the three most popular television brands were
      first identified based on the number of available models. The average
      star rating of each screen technology used by these brands was then
      calculated to determine which technology delivers the highest customer
      satisfaction.

  <!-- Question 2 -->
  <div class="chart-block">
    <h3>Among the most popular brands, which brand is the most energy-efficient?</h3>

    <p>
      Energy efficiency was evaluated by comparing both screen size and power
      consumption. A larger screen typically requires more electricity, so an
      efficiency score was calculated by analysing how much screen size each
      brand delivers relative to its power usage. This allows a balanced
      comparison between performance and energy consumption.

    <h3>Final Recommendation</h3>


    <p class="insight">
      <strong>Takeaway:</strong> The best television choice depends on user
      priorities. Buyers seeking premium viewing quality may focus on screen
      technology, while environmentally conscious buyers may prioritise
      energy-efficient brands.
