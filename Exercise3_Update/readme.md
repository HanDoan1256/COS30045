Exercise 3:

Data source: Exercise 2
Data processing: Exercise 2

Key point: Assuming the audiences are non-technical household decision-makers, who are mostly interested in cost savings, energy effienciency and practical actions only, the charts displayed must be simple and deliver key neccessary messages. 

Data Story:
Audience:
- Not highly technical
- Care about product quality and value
- Want simple comparison between popular brands
- Interested in ratings, efficiency and modern technology

Audience Interests:
Prefers quick recommendations and visual comparisons to choose a high rating TV.


The two questions chosen to answer their needs will be:
1. Among the top 3 most popular brands (brands with most models), based on star rating, which Screen technology is the best? 
2. Among the top 3 most popular brands (brands with most models), based on power consume and screen size, which brand will be the most effienct?


I acknowledge the use of GitHub Copilot in the development of this project.
Gen-AI was used in the following ways:

- Generating initial drafts of textual content for the Home, Televisions, and About Us pages (e.g. mission statements, key facts lists, energy efficiency tips, and explanatory paragraphs based on Australian energy context).
- Suggesting improvements and completing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippets to implement navigation, active link highlighting, page structure consistency, and event handling (after I provided the base HTML skeleton and navigation concept).
- Refining wording for clarity, factual accuracy, and user-friendliness in the provided content sections.
- All AI-generated text and code suggestions were carefully reviewed, edited, fact-checked by me to ensure they aligned with the project requirements and my own understanding.

Through the exercise, I get to practice my html and my javascript again, as well as adjust the styles so my website turns out as good as possible.
